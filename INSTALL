This file describes the installation of Chirp without package management 
on Linux and other Unix-like operating systems.  This sort of thing may 
be your only choice because 1) a package has not yet been made for your 
OS or distribution, 2) the packaged version is obsolete, or 3) you want 
to try a daily build.


For Debian, Ubuntu, and related systems, the following packages are required:
python
python-gtk2
python-libxml2
python-libxslt1
python-serial
python-suds (optional)
python-support

For Redhat, Fedora, CentOS and related systems, the following packages 
are required: (This list is incomplete.  Please submit corrections.)
python
pygtk2
libxml2-python
python-libxslt

For openSUSE, the following packages are required:
python
python-gtk
python-pyserial
python-libxml2
libxslt-python
python-suds-jurko

Once these packages are installed, you can run Chirp directly from the 
distribution directory by typing "./chirpw".  If you want to install it 
properly, type this:

  sudo python setup.py install --record files.txt

This will install the package and create a list of files that were 
added to your system.  If you want to deinstall Chirp, type this: 

  sudo xargs -0 rm -rf < files.txt

This will cause rm(1) to take its list of arguments from the file named 
"files.txt" and remove those files from the system.  If you forgot to 
create "files.txt", you can simply reinstall the way it is shown here 
and continue on your way.

Note: This will not uninstall directories created by the installation of 
Chirp.  Presence of these empty directories shouldn't be a problem, but 
if they are, it's easy to go through the files.txt file, identify them, 
and remove them.
