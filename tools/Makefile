#
#	This makefile checks to see if we are running under the OS "Darwin"
#	and passes the proper macro flag ("MACOS") if we are.
#
#	Incidentally, it is noteworthy that MacOS (Darwin) is not the only
#	operating system which is deficient some of the library routines
#	MacOS is currently defficient. Thus, it is instructive that other
#	operating systems names might need to be added for compilation to
#	become occurring in their environments.
