    ## Meaning of this testing

    The goal here is not necessarily to test the drivers themselves in terms of
    actual functionality, but rather to validate the Python 3 conversion
    work required of nearly all drivers. Thus, we are not trying to
    comprehensively test these models so much as make sure they work at least
    as well as they do on the Python 2 branch. Uncovering and reporting new
    bugs is definitely welcome, but for the purpoes of this effort, "no worse
    than the legacy branch" is good enough. There are multiple levels of
    confirmation in the matrix above:
    * Tested with real hardware (i.e. a person listed in the "Tester" column)
      using roughly the procedure below.
    * An "implied by (model)" link means that another model was tested, and it
      is so similar, that the model on that line can be considered tested as
      well.
    * A "probably works" link means that the driver has not been tested with
      real hardware, nor is it substantially similar to another model, but
      shares a common base that entirely provides the cloning routines with
      other drivers that have been tested with real hardware, such that
      confidence is high that it will work. Only drivers with test images in
      the tree (or live drivers) should be marked with this class.

    If you have a model listed in this matrix with either "implied" or
    "probably works" status, an actual confirmation with real hardware is
    welcome and can replace the weaker reference.

    ## Minimal test prodecure
    For the purposes of the Python 3 effort, a "tested" radio means
    at least the following procedure was followed:
    1. Download from the radio
    1. Make some change to a memory
    1. If the radio has settings support, make sure settings load and tweak one setting
    1. Upload to the radio
    1. Confirm that the changes stick and look correct, or at least are not a
       regression from the master py2 branch.

    The drivers are all passing the automated tests, but tests with real hardware
    and serial ports is important, especially around bytes-vs-string safety.

    To update this document, add/edit entries in `tests/py3_driver_testers.txt` and
    then run `tox -e makesupported`. Commit the result (including the changes to this `.md`
    file) and submit a PR.

    The "Byte Clean" flag refers to whether or not the radio has set the
    `NEEDS_COMPAT_SERIAL = False` flag on the radio class, and thus uses
    `MemoryMapBytes` exclusively internally. Whenever possible, all radios
    that are fixed for py3 should do so with this flag set to False and with
    the byte-native memory map.
