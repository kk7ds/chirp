# CHIRP Project

This is the official git repository for the
__[CHIRP](https://chirp.danplanet.com)__ project. This repo is mirrored to
the legacy mercurial repo and patches are still accepted via the mailing list
against that repository for existing contributors. New contributions are
preferred as PRs here.

When submitting PRs, please squash commits into logical units in a fashion
similar to what is currently expected by the project on the mailing list.
