# CHIRP Project

This is the official git repository for the
__[CHIRP](https://chirp.danplanet.com)__ project. Pull requests are accepted
here, but for the moment, the main repository is still on mercurial.
Changesets will be mirrored in both directions, but may not always happen
immediately.

When submitting PRs, please squash commits into logical units in a fashion
similar to what is currently expected by the project on the mailing list.
