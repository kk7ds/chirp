# This is a list of tests that are expected to fail. DO NOT add new things to
# this file without careful consideration and discussion. This is not a tool
# to avoid fixing failures, it is purely a stop-gap to allow temporary
# failures to avoid breaking the build while iterating towards a fix.

# One line per test nodeid with a comment above citing a bug number, example:
# Bug #10931: FT-450 mem.extra fields cause UI corruption
